  These benefits are exempt from the new benefit cap:

  <% exempt_benefits.each do |exempt_benefit| %>
     - <%= exempt_benefit %>
  <% end %>

  You may be affected by the new cap if your circumstances change.

  You can check if you’re affected by the [current benefits cap](/benefit-cap-calculator/y/default).
