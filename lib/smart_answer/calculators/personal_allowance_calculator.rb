    # if you earn over the income limit for age-related allowance
    # then your age-related allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2
    # you earn over the limit until the personal allowance is reached,
    # at which point reduction stops (the basic personal allowance is not
    # reduced)

    # in addition, if you earn over the income limit for personal allowance
    # your personal allwowance is reduced in the same way. In the year 2012-13
    # this limit was £100,000 so no need to include it in this calculation
    # as we've already gone way over where it would make a difference to your MCA.

    # so this class could be extended so that it returns the personal allowance
    # you are entitled to based on your age and income.
