Based on the answers you’ve given, you will be affected by the outside London benefit cap from autumn 2016.


Your benefits | Outside London benefit cap
-|-
£700.00 | £257.69

This means your Housing Benefit in autumn 2016 will now be: £0.50.

##How this is worked out

The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over the outside London benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

Total amount of benefits affected by the outside London cap: £700.00

Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over the outside London benefit cap of £257.69:

Total benefits affected: £700.00

Minus outside London benefit cap: £257.69

Total over outside London cap: £442.31

Housing benefit: £50.00

Minus total over outside London cap: £442.31

New Housing Benefit amount: £0.50

Your Housing Benefit won’t be reduced to 0. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.
