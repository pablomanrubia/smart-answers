Based on the answers you’ve given, you will be affected by the Greater London benefit cap from autumn 2016.


Your benefits | Greater London benefit cap
-|-
£1000.00 | £296.35

This means your Housing Benefit in autumn 2016 will now be: £0.50.

##How this is worked out

The benefits you get are added together. The total amount of benefits over your benefit cap is subtracted from your Housing Benefit:

Total amount of benefits affected by the Greater London cap: £1000.00

Your Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount you are over your benefit cap of £296.35:

Total benefits affected: £1000.00

Minus Greater London benefit cap: £296.35

Total over Greater London cap: £703.65

Housing benefit: £350.00

Minus total over Greater London cap: £703.65

New Housing Benefit amount: £0.50

Your Housing Benefit won’t be reduced to 0. You need to be getting some Housing Benefit to be eligible for other services.
