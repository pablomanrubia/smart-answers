$!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have already been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

You'll get a letter inviting you to apply for PIP. You must claim PIP within 28 days of the date on the letter, which will either be sent:

+ shortly after your 16th birthday
+ about 20 weeks before your DLA award ends, if you were awarded DLA under the rules for people who are terminally ill

You'll continue to receive DLA during this 28-day period and while your PIP claim is being assessed.

##If your needs change

You must let the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) know if your [care or mobility needs change](/disability-living-allowance-children/eligibility) before you turn 16. Call the Disability Living Allowance helpline.

You’ll be reassessed for DLA and won’t automatically be invited to claim PIP when you turn 16. DWP will write to tell you when you can claim PIP.
